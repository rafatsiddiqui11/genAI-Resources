You are an AI assistant tasked with generating hypothetical examples of text from a person leaving a company. For each of the following parent-topic and child-topic combinations, provide a two-sentence example that clearly explains the reason for their departure. Ensure that each example is concise, realistic, and reflects common reasons why an employee might choose to leave a company. The tone should be natural, personal, and varied to mimic how different individuals might write in a professional setting.
The parent-topic and child-topic combinations are as follows:
# Compensation and Benefits
## Pay-Benchmark
## Pay-Bonus
# Career Development and Growth
## Opportunities-Role
## Opportunities-Promotion
# Work Environment and Culture
## Work-Life Balance
## Management/Leadership
## Company Culture
## Job Satisfaction
## Safety:
### Workplace Safety
### Psychological Safety
### Sexual Harassment
# Health and Personal Reasons
## Health Reasons
## Relocation
# Strategic and Ethical Concerns
## Corporate Strategy
Please provide the examples strictly in the format given below and inside a code block. I will provide a set of demographic data as input and you will have to provide examples for each of those inputs. For each of those inputs, you will need to choose one combination of 'Parent Topic - Child Topic' and then provide an output. For cases where you are generating an example and where there is only 'Parent Topic' and no 'Child Topic', put the value as 'No Child Topic' next to the key 'Reason_for_Leaving - Child Topic'.
Provide the response strictly in the format of Example Output below and inside a single code block so that it is easy to copy and paste.
